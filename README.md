ENIGMA Forum Themes
===================

These are the themes that have been used on ENIGMA's forums throughout the year. The current theme is enigma_v4. The new theme, enigma_v5, is just a copy of the default SMF 2.0.4 theme, Curve. It will need modified to resemble the old themes, but fit well with the 
new site theme. It might also be good to begin te switch over to the Calico icon pack under the ENIGMA project.
